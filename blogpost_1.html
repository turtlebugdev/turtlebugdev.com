        <H1>TurtleBugDev's First Blog Post</H1>
        <p>So... I started a <strong>thing</strong>...</p>
        <p>About a week ago I started <em>#100DaysofCode</em>. At the same
            time I started working my way through 
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.

        <p><strong> The Odin Project?</strong></p>
        <p>I've been playing around with code for about a decade now. I code queries in SQL everyday at work. In my free time I've 
            done some game programming in Gamemaker and Gamemaker 2. I've also edited a few python queries and completed a few trainings on python 
            on Youtube. I decided that I wanted to utilize my cacity for code for a side gig by doing web development on the side.
        </p>
        <p>I don't have time to go back to school fulltime, nor could I afford to take 12-18 weeks of work financially. So I knew I needed to do this
            "self-taught". I looked at a bunch of posts about software dev. I started with <em>freecodeacademy</em> for a couple lessons. But I found 
            it wasn't really sticking in my head. I then found <em>app academy open</em> and started going thru their curriculum. It is good, and I 
            may come back to it, specifically for Python. But in the end I found The Odin Project and it really seemed to click. It's a lot more reading
            and doing stuff on your own (setting up a linux environment for example), but I'm really digging it and I'm learning a lot.
