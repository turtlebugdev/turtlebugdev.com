        <h1>About TurtleBugDev</h1>
        <p>
            I'm TurtleBugDev, though my actual name is Robert Broughton. Ive been fiddling with technology
            for quite some time. By day I am an analyst for a large metropolitan police department in the 
            Southeastern United States. I'm a husband, father, Christ follower, and programmer. Over the 
            last few years I've tried to pick up programming by completing various video tutorials on how
            to make games in gamemaker or the foundamentals of python or javascript. I've managed to learn
            the basics of gamemaker, but none of the other stuff has really stuck. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing as I've managed to get myself into tutorial purgatory I had to think of a way out. So I've
            decided to closely follow a more detailed and structured program. After looking at and trying a 
            little bit of freecodecamp and app academy open, but not finding them as to my liking, I've settled
            on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"> The Odin Project</a>.

            This website is going to grow as I grow as a developer. You will see it change as I learn more. Check 
            back often to note improvements. Eventually this site will look profesional and will host projects I'll
            make in HTMl, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and I might even share some of what I made in Gamemaker one day.
            But for now you have a glimpse of a completely HTML site someone made by hand without any CSS or JavaScript.
